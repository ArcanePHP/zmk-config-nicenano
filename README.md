# Quick Summary

- :heavy_check_mark: 5x12 Ortholinear Keyboard
- :heavy_check_mark: Hotswappable
- :heavy_check_mark: Modular Spacebar 1x4u (58 keys) or 2x2u (59 keys)
- :heavy_check_mark: Wireless Bluetooth /w nice!nano running ZMK firmware

## Why?

I'm a clumsy man and I often hit the corner of my [96% keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/collections/96-layout-keyboards/products/keychron-k4-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-version-2) when I move my mouse.

So instead of doing the sensible thing and getting a TKL or smaller keyboard, I took the nuclear option of going straight into ortholinear keyboards (because I wanted one and to be honest, they look cool). 

There was a problem though. 

Of all the current 5x12 ortholinear keyboards on the market, I couldn't find one that was a) wireless and b) using a 1x4u spacebar or 2x2u spacebar setup. 

Either I wait for someone to make and sell it or I build it myself.

So... here I am, learning how to make it from the ground up over the course of a few months with no knowledge of pcb design and keyboard form factors. 

Here are some of the steps I've taken to make it.

#### PCB Design
- USB port on the left since it couldn't fit on the top
- Added a reset switch into the board for quick firmware flashing
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Schematic</td>
     <td>Trace Routing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/01_schematic.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/02_kicad_pcb.png" width=450</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>PCB Front</td>
     <td>PCB Back</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/03_pcb_front.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/04_pcb_back.png" width=450</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

<sub><sup>Routing traces is literally playing the Tron Light Cycle game with copper lines instead of bikes.</sup></sub>


#### Top Plate
- 3D Printed with PLA filament at 100% infill

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>4U Spacebar Top Plate</td>
     <td>2x2u Spacebar Top Plate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/05_model_grill_4u.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/06_model_grill_2x2u.png" width=450</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 

#### Enclosure
- Inclined at a [7Â° angle](https://matt3o.com/about-mt3-profile-and-devtty-set/) as suggested by the MT3 Profile Creator
- Bezeled inner case to support the PCB
- 3D Printed at 100% infill for structural integrity as well 
- Print time was roughly ~60 hours

  <tr>
    <td>Top View</td>
     <td>Left View</td>
      <td>Right View</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/07_model_top.png" width=450</td>

  </tr>
 </table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Wireframe Right View</td>
     <td>Back View</td>
      <td>Wireframe Back View</td>
       <td>Bottom View w/ hex screwholes & reset port</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td><img src="/images/13_model_bottom.png" width=450</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


#### 5x12 Ortho Build
- Added an on/off switch to quickly manually reset the battery powered MCU
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Soldering hotwap switches & diodes</td>
     <td>Note scribbles trying to figure out the row & col pinouts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/15_5x12_build.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/16_5x12_build.png" width=450</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 

#### 4u Spacebar Setup
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Box Kailh Switches</td>
     <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/19_5x12_build.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/20_5x12_build.png" width=450</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


#### 2x2u Spacebar Setup
- Tactile Browns on Alphas, Space & Enter
- Clicky on Modifiers, Arrows and Numerals

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Box Brown, Orange, Royal Navy Switches</td>
     <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/21_5x12_build.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/22_5x12_build.png" width=450</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


## Completed Board \o/
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
     <td></td>
      <td>On/Off Switch for easy access</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/23_5x12.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/24_5x12.png" width=450</td>
    <td><img src="/images/25_5x12.png" width=450</td>
